    "- This case walks through creating AI applications and agents with **LangChain** and **LangGraph**.\n",
    "- The use case is to take a URL, load the contents and have them extracted by a language model to create a unified summary.\n",
    "- We will spin up the straight forward way to extract article content to use for development and benchmarking in this Notebook to examine the most basic pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to streamline a basic ai-induced workflow. We are simply not iterested in writing explicit logic to extract human-readable data from website data - so using an LM for that. \n",
    "While agentic would imply an LM to make core workflow decisions, our LMs here only execute a single instruction, not even a loop questioning the own output is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is something different: make an ai task predictable given a certain type of input. This does not much magic, it's more like we caged Dumbledore in a cell to only have him summon our same four favourite snacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this, many LMs support a concept called **Structured Output** natively. Actually, this is pretty straightforward if you interpret LMs as fill-in-the-blank engines. Usually, the blank we are providing is the empty space after our question(mark). But LMs are perfectly working with intermediate spaces to fill in the. That way you can create expressions with guarnteed patterns like we know it from String interpolation. In Python e.g. you can use curly brackets inside f\"\"-Strings to reference variables, where its' values will be baked into the string at place at runtime. In the same way we can pass a fill-in-the-blank text, where we indicate the blanks with curly brackets and put individual sub-prompts about what to fill into these gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way we can make our output machine-usable in classic workflows. (LangChain offers a very elegant way to Python your way through this)\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, we might want to encapsulate this logic and actually use it inside agentic workflows. But this will not be covered by this notebook, as this will require more code and abstraction, while we simply want to play on the open heart here.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as a special, we will encapsulate parts to make them iterable over a range of model configurations to batch-execute and compare by a single input.\n",
    "Finally, we will encapsulate our agent as a single piece of work to wrap it into a tool, that you might use further, if you want to extend this notebook."
